            <h1>Manafest’s New Album, Reborn – Is it What the Fans Wanted?</h1>
            <h5>Posted by Linda Fau | June 25, 2016 | Reviews</h5>
            <h2>Manafest Demonstrates Creativity in Independent New Christian Music Release</h2>
            <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/Reborn_Manafest_album.jpg" alt="albumcover">Recording under the name, Manifest Chris Greenwood’s albums have always exhibited a lot of creativity. Recording with the BEC Recordings label for the last decade, his recent album titled Reborn, being released independently, having being funded as a Pledge Music project, has given him full control to express himself freely. In a Christian music review about the title track on the album, JesusFreakHideout.com staff member, Kevin Hoskins states, “While I give Mana props for creativity, it’s not exactly what fans are probably looking or hoping for.” (Hoskins, 2015) I’m not sure that I agree. Do fans object to being surprised by musical creativity and instead look for the predictable? I think many of Manafest’s fans appreciate his creativity and I feel new listeners will enjoy an album that changes it up a bit.</p>
            <h2>What Do Fans Expect from New Music</h2>
            <p>Thinking about Hoskin’s comment has me pondering what fans expect from the bands that they follow. Once listeners latch onto a band’s sound, is that the sound they expect them to deliver album after album? Do they expect a whole new album of great songs following the same basic style as the last one? If genre lines are crossed, are fans generally turned off or intrigued? These are interesting questions to explore. Is it primarily the quality of the songs and how the album as a whole works together that fans judge? Do fans look at each album as a separate, unique work or is each album compared to the others in determining how much they like it? We will report our findings as research is conducted to find the answer to these questions. Musicians should have an idea of what their fans expect from their music to predict the success of their album projects.</p>
